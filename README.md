A computational BSc Physics project at Imperial College London.

Branch naming convention:  
* feat:      Feature being added or expanded 
* bug:       Bug fix  
* junk:      Throwaway branch created for experimenting  
* (any other commits, such as style changes, documentation and minor text fixes, can be pushed straight onto the dev branch)

Once each branch is completed, merge it to the dev branch. Make sure the dev branch still works!

We aim to follow a Test-Driven-Development (TDD) method, which ideally means that various unittests should be created before each stage of development. However, this cannot be easily achieved due to time restraint.
