# To-Do List

1. Gitkrakren
2. Basic Outline
3. Bug - Move, Energy, Reproduce

------QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED------

1. Food - Reproduce? Gains Energy Value?

2. Overlap
	Yes - How share the food
	No - How to not favour one bug over another? Checking if two bugs will move to the same place?
		Checking if the space is already occupied? 

3. Reproduction - How will reproduction work?
			Same square? (Overlap needs to be yes)
			Random squares around it?
		

------EXTENDING THE SYSTEM------

Evolution/Mutation (random reproduction threshold.etc)

1. Predators - Could bugs evolve into Predators? How fast do they move? 
2. Vision - How far can a bug see? What is the degree of its vision? Do bugs react to predators and vice versa?
3. Genes - Vision, Speed, Reproduciton Rate, Maybe eating speed (if we allow overlap and let bugs share food)
		What about random mutations?

------EXTENDING THE SYSTEM POSSIBLY UNCESSARILY------

4. Evolving Food e.g. Energy Levels, Colours
5. Obstructions e.g. Rocks

------TO DO------

1. non random walk seems like a lot of effort, probably better spend time elsewhere
2. no point tracking the movement of each individual bug (a tail) in a such a big world, especially if not doing random walk
3. so we should collect data now? Then do different food distributions, then decide on another trait to evolve so we can implement contours
4. this gives us time to look into population models (equations), percolation, and try to optimise and implement SOLID I guess

DESIGN DECISIONS -> Number of offspring (currently set at 2)/ Or need another evolutionary trait
Gene Contours (2D gene plots)
Run Faster
SOLID

Equilibrium (Percoloation - Statistical Mechanics)
Population Equations (Model)
