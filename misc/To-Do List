# To-Do List

1. Gitkrakren
2. Basic Outline
3. Bug - Move, Energy, Reproduce

------QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED------

1. Food - Reproduce? Gains Energy Value?

2. Overlap
	Yes - How share the food
	No - How to not favour one bug over another? Checking if two bugs will move to the same place?
		Checking if the space is already occupied? 

3. Reproduction - How will reproduction work?
			Same square? (Overlap needs to be yes)
			Random squares around it?
		

------EXTENDING THE SYSTEM------

1. Predators - Could bugs evolve into Predators? How fast do they move? 
2. Vision - How far can a bug see? What is the degree of its vision? Do bugs react to predators and vice versa?
3. Genes - Vision, Speed, Reproduciton Rate, Maybe eating speed (if we allow overlap and let bugs share food)
		What about random mutations?

------EXTENDING THE SYSTEM POSSIBLY UNCESSARILY------

4. Evolving Food e.g. Energy Levels, Colours
5. Obstructions e.g. Rocks

------TO DO------

Grows/Respire values
Random Walk
Timer on Images
World Seed
Data: Lifetime(Bug/Food)
Data: Population(Bug/Food)
Run Faster
SOLID

Equilibrium (Percoloation - Statistical Mechanics)

Mutations (random energy.etc)
